# `Data Quality Dimensions`

Data quality dimensions are measurement attributes of data, which you can individually identify, interpret, and improve. In the specific context of your organization, the aggregated scores of multiple dimensions represent data quality and indicate the level of quality of your data.

The data quality dimensions can vary depending on the source or framework used, but there are commonly six to ten dimensions that are frequently acknowledged.

<b><h3>Uniqueness:</h3></b> That ensure that each record or data entity is distinct and does not have duplicates within the dataset.
<b><h3>Accuracy:</h3></b> That ensure that data accurately represents the real-world entities or events it is intended to describe. In other words, accurate data is free from errors and faithfully reflects the true values or conditions it is supposed to represent.
<b><h3>Completeness:</h3></b> That ensure that all required data elements are present in a dataset, without any missing or omitted values.
<b><h3>Validity:</h3></b> That ensures that data adheres to predefined rules, standards, or constraints. Valid data meets the established criteria for correctness and conforms to the expected format, range, or structure.
<b><h3>Consistency:</h3></b> That ensure that data is uniform and coherent across various sources, databases, or time periods. It ensures that data is free from discrepancies, contradictions, or conflicts, and that it maintains a standardized format or structure.
<b><h3>Timeliness:</h3></b> That ensure that data is available within the expected or required time-frame. It emphasizes the importance of data being up-to-date and relevant for its intended use.
